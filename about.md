#About

My name is Jerry Sun, and this is my blog.

I am a Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.  In the past, I've work at various companies in Canada and the United States doing development in C/C++, Python, C#, and Java.

I am interested in embedded and OS-level programming, as well as mobile application development.

I enjoy basketball, Ultimate Frisbee, and Starcraft II.
