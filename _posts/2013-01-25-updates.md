Inspired by [friends](http://hanjun.me), I've decided to update the look of the site.  Looking back, I think the previous layout was too boring.  The new layout now has some actual contrast!

The texture used in the banner and background come from [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com).  I'm second-guessing my choice on the background texture though.  It doesn't stand out enough and just looks like a gray background from afar.

<div class="image-thumb left">
  <img src="/res/images/updates-dropshadow.png"/>
  <div class="caption">So tacky</div>
</div>

I experimented with using a drop shadow around the main content box but that turned, but the end result looked very tacky and ugly.


More JavaScript was used this time around to maintain layout fidelity when resizing the browser window after the page has rendered.  JQuery made this process a lot easier vs. conventional Javascript.  For example, the code to set a margin in JavaScript with JQuery is:

<pre class="code">
$("#links").css('marginRight', '10px');
</pre>

There will still more planned updates in the future, such as a enlarging and displaying only a picture, with the rest of the page blacked out, a better way to display code, that includes line numbers, and a better looking image + caption layout.
