Inspired by [friends](http://hanjun.me), I've decided to update the look of the site.  Looking back, I think the previous layout was too boring.  The new layout now has some actual contrast!

The texture used in the banner and background come from [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com).  I'm second-guessing my choice on the background texture though.  It doesn't stand out enough and just looks like a gray background from afar.

I experimented with using a drop shadow around the main content box but that turned, but the end result looked very tacky and ugly.
<div class="image-thumb"><img src="/res/images/updates-dropshadow.png"/>So tacky</div>

More Javascript was used this time around to maintain layout fidelity when resizing the browser window after the page has rendered.  JQuery made this process a lot easier vs. conventional Javascript.  For example, the code to set a margin in JQuery is: `$("#links").css('marginRight', '10px');`

There will still more planned updates in the future, such as a enlarging and displaying only a picture, with the rest of the page blacked out, a better way to display code, that includes line numbers, and a better looking image + caption layout.
