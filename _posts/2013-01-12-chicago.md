I visited Chicago in the New Year (Jan 1 - Jan 6) with my girlfriend.  Even though it was 5 days away from home, 2 of those days were spent on the road driving from Toronto to Chicago.

On the way there, I decided to take the Sarnia bridge to the USA rather than Windsor in order to avoid Detroit.  I passed through Detroit when I was young and did not have a fond memory of the city.  The customs agent at the border asked an unusual amount of questions, including who's car I was driving, and where I got the money to pay for the car.

The first thing I noticed when driving in the states was the poor condition of the highway.  The first bit of driving from the bridge was along I-69.  The road was incredibly bumpy and noisy, and made for a poor drive.  The road condition got a lot better once we merged onto I-94.

In Chicago, we stayed the Holiday Inn Express on Magnificent Mile.  The hotel room was quite small and the windows had a draft which I had to plug with a towel.  However, the hotel was the only one of the few hotels we found that had breakfast in the morning.

On the first day, we went to see Shedd Aquarium and the Field Museum.  My girlfriend enjoyed the aquarium very much, especially the penguin display.  She was ecstatic when a penguin waddled infront of the crowd during the dolphin show, without a piece of a glass separating it and the spectators.

The Field Museum was less exciting than the Shedd Aquarium and we were not allowed to take photographs of some of the special exhibits.

The choice of location for the aquarium and museum was absolutely breath-taking.  On a clear day, you are able to see the entire Chicago skyline, as the aquarium is on a small penninsula outside of the downtown core.

For dinner that night, we ate at Lou Malnatti's, a well-reviewed chain restaurant, known for its deep-dish pizza.  Though neither of us were fans of the deep-dish pizza we received that night, the salad we had was the best salad we've ever had.  The vinaigrette was sweet, but not too sweet tasting, and enhanced by the use of bruschetta in the salad.

The next day, we went shopping at the outlet mall, but neither of us had much to buy.  Along the way to the outlet mall, we encountered an automatic highway exit toll that asked for $1.10 in change.  Luckily the toll did not have a barricade and I just drove through them.

That night, we ate at Kuma's Corner, a heavy metal themed burger joint.  When we arrived, we looked at a 30 minute wait, but fortunately, three tables ahead of us left and we were seated quite quickly.  I don't remember the specifics of the burgers we received other than that they were pretty good.  Neither of us cared for the loud heavy metal that the restaurant blasted though.

That night, we visited the Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower).  The view from the top of the tower was quite nice.  We also encountered a group of hispanic teenagers and one Asian couple who were afraid of the glass floor.

On our last day, we visited the Museum of Science and Industry.  I found this musuem to be slightly more intersting than the Field Museum, but like the Field Musuem and Shedd Aquarium, it was filled with kids who were on Christmas holidays.

Afterwards, we went to Millenium Park to take some tourist pictures with the giant reflective bean.

All in all, Chicago is a very nice city to visit.  Looking at the layout of its city center, the city feels much more like a tourist city than Toronto does.  While Toronto's downtown core is being filled with condos, I did not find too many condos in downtown Chicago.  The downtown buildings are right on the lakeshore in Chicago, rather than being a bit inland like in Toronto.  This leads to a better looking skyline at night as you're able to better see the bigger buildings.

I know this post is worthless without pictures so I will include them with this post once I've finished the picture stylesheets.
