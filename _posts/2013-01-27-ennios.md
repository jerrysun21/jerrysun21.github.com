My girlfriend and I went to Ennio's for our anniversary dinner a few nights ago.  Upon arriving, the environment didn't stand out to me particularly.  The restaurant's decoration reminded me more of a British pub than an Italian restaurant.

My girlfriend ordered a pasta with spicy sausage and I had a lasagna.  Both dishes came with an order of garden salad and bread with olive oil dip.  The olive oil dip had some chopped up coriander which tasted great.  The salad vinaigrette was too sour for my taste, but my girlfriend seemed to like it.

The lasagna I received was much smaller than the pasta my girlfriend received.  While the tomato sauce tasted good and there was a generous amount of cheese, I didn't really taste any meat in the lasagna.  It was only upon close inspection that I noticed small chunks of ground beef, but could hardly taste or feel the pieces in my mouth.

On the other hand, the pasta had very noticeable pieces of sausage spread throughout the dish.  Unfortunately, the spiciness of the pasta was only limited to the sausage.  Taking a bite of without any sausage left only a taste of tomato sauce (which wasn't sour or salty enough) in my mouth.

For dessert, we ordered a piece of New York cheesecake.  Piece of quite small, but tasted very good.  The slight sourness of the cheesecake went very well with the whipped cream topping, which helped to mask some of the adicity.

Something I pondered during this visit was interview process for the wait staff.  When I went to the Cheesecake factory in Chicago, my waiter there was excellent.  He refilled water, came to refill the water, and asked about the meal, all at the right time.  At Ennio's, our waitress never bothered to refill the water, and interrupted our conversation twice to take the order.  Even worse, the long-haired waitress that's caked with makeup at Bubble Tease in the Campus Plaza has to be the worst of them all.  She never ties her hair back, and carries herself with a general attitude of dis-interest and arrogance.  How do restaurants owners screen for this kind of behavior?  The wait staff can make or ruin a night of dining, regardless of the quality of food.  Even small things like coming to take an order during a conversation can have negative effects on the dining experience.

Conclusions?  Decent restaurant, not worth the price.

P.S. This is the first post I'm writing without first previewing it, open it turns out well.
